# What is Build2Learn?


**Build to Learn** is an initiative by a group of volunteers to help people learn programming by building useful micro-products. Our motto is â€“ Build to Learn and Learn to Build.

Anyone who wants to learn or build or do both can participate. We plan to meet a few times a week in 3-4 hour coding sessions and build useful products.

The setting is informal. You can start with a simple one paragraph definition of a product and recruit volunteers to work with you on the idea. We do not have any rigid processes. The team can decide how to interact.

We had the first session on the 3rd of February and 10 of us were present. We started 4 projects. We hope you can all join and either learn or help others learn.

More things coming soon stay tuned! ðŸ˜Ž
